<p>The exercises in this book are all based on <a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a>
repositories hosted on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. This is a deliberate
choice, because learning to use a revision control system such as Git is an
important part of learning to be a good programmer. If you’re doing these
exercises as a part of a formal course, then GitHub classroom provides
additional support for automatically creating your personal repository for each
exercise, for submitting your work, and providing feedback through autotesting.
If you’re working through this book yourself, you’ll be able to use the
template repositories on GitHub to access everything you need to do the
exercises.</p>
<p>This introduction just provides enough information to enable you to set up
and use Git, GitHub, and GitHub Classroom for the exercises in this book.
For a more in-depth introduction to Git and GitHub, you are encouraged to
work through the excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/">Git tutorial provided by the Software Carpentry
project</a>.</p>
<section id="what-is-git">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.1. </span>What is Git?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-git" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>When we’re writing code, we typically don’t just type it out, notice that it
works, and stop. Instead, the usual cycle looks a bit more like this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Write a small piece of code.</p></li>
<li><p>Use it to run some test problems to see if it works.</p></li>
<li><p>If there were problems, make a change and go back to step 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Once it’s working, go back to step 1 and write the next small piece of code.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each time we get to step 4, we’re a little closer to having a working program
that does what we want. However, each time we go back through steps 1-3, we run
the risk that we don’t just implement a new feature, but that in doing so we
break something we already had working. How do we make sure that we always know
exactly what the code used to look like when it worked?</p>
<p>One answer is to keep saving old versions under different names. This is a bad
answer for two reasons. The first is that it swiftly descends into a confused
mess, as anyone who has ever been emailed a Word file named
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">report_draft_final_revised2_johns_comments.doc</span></code> can attest! The second is that
the names of files and code objects often matter to programming languages - so
the mere action of saving your code under a different name can stop it working.</p>
<p>The right answer to the problems caused by constantly updating code (or any
other document) is a version control system. Sometimes these are also called
source control systems, or revision control systems. A version control system
is a piece of software which keeps track of versions of a collection of files
such as a software project. A well-used version control system can tell you:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>What changed in the files.</p></li>
<li><p>When the change happened.</p></li>
<li><p>Who made the changes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Version control systems also help with the edit conflicts that can occur
when more than one person edits a file, for example as a part of a group
project - or even when you edit the same file on two different computers.</p>
<p>Git is one such version control system, and it’s one of the most capable and
widely used currently available.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-github">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.2. </span>What is GitHub?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-github" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Git keeps track of a collection of files stored in a project folder called a
repository which is kept on your computer. That’s great but what if you want to
do any of the following?</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Collaborate with someone else who also needs to edit the files.</p></li>
<li><p>Work on more than one computer.</p></li>
<li><p>Still have your repository if your computer is lost or your hard disk dies.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://GitHub.com">GitHub</a> is a cloud service which stores copies of Git
repositories online. You can <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">push</span></code> your changes up to GitHub from any computer
with an internet connection and <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pull</span></code> those changes down to any other computer.
GitHub also integrates with other software development tools such as automatic
testing frameworks, issue trackers and code review to provide a comprehensive
software development platform. Depending on the module you are taking, you may
also use some of these extra features of GitHub, but we will mostly focus on how
to use the core feature of storing a copy of your repository online.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-github-classroom">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.3. </span>What is GitHub Classroom?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-github-classroom" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>All of the collaborative features of Git and GitHub might sound like overkill
when all you need to do is complete coding assignments that only you work on.
However in software development terms, you always have at least one
collaborator on your assignments: the module lecturer. Usually the lecturer
provides some initial skeleton code, such as some incomplete source files or
Jupyter notebooks. During the course of the work, you might need to show your
code to the lecturer or a teaching assistant in order to get help, and at the
end you need to share your work with the module staff to get it marked.</p>
<p>GitHub Classroom is a service that works with GitHub to provide every student
doing a particular coding exercise with their own repository on GitHub that’s
prepopulated with the lecturer’s skeleton code and ready to work with. As we’ll
see below, this makes it really easy to obtain the exercise and work with it.</p>

<section id="configuring-git">
<span id="configure-git"></span><h2><span class="section-number">2.4. </span>Configuring Git<a class="headerlink" href="#configuring-git" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Git needs a little bit of configuration to work smoothly. This configuration
belongs to the computer you’re running Git on, so you don’t have to do this for
each project, but you do have to do it for each computer you log into. If
you use different machines that share your home folder on a network drive,
which is a common configuration in many workplaces and university computer
labs, then you’ll only need to set up Git once for that whole cluster of
computers.</p>
<p>Before you start configuring Git, you’ll want to make sure that you have a
working Git installation using the instructions on the book web page:
<a class="reference external" href="https://object-oriented-python.github.io/installation.html">https://object-oriented-python.github.io/installation.html</a></p>
<section id="your-details">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.4.1. </span>Your details<a class="headerlink" href="#your-details" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>First you need to tell Git about your name and email address. This has nothing
directly to do with the information you provided to GitHub, instead it will
just be used by Git to label you as the author of the code that you write. To
save on a great deal of confusion later, you should register the actual name
that you usually go by. The email address simply needs to be a working email
address which will reach you. <a class="reference external" href="https://imperial-fons-computing.github.io/terminal.html#terminal" title="(in Installation instructions for FoNS v2020.0)"><span class="xref std std-ref">Open a terminal</span></a> and run the
following commands, replacing your name as appropriate:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>git<span class="w"> </span>config<span class="w"> </span>--global<span class="w"> </span>user.name<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;Jo Student&quot;</span>

<section id="line-endings">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.4.2. </span>Line endings<a class="headerlink" href="#line-endings" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When a text file, such as a program source file, contains a line break, this is
represented by a special invisible character. Unfortunately, it’s not the same
character on different operating systems, which can make a bit of a mess when a
file is created on one operating system, and then edited on another - such as
might happen if your lecturer uses a different operating system for you. We can
set up Git to automatically clean up this mess in most cases.</p>

<section id="text-editor">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.4.3. </span>Text editor<a class="headerlink" href="#text-editor" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Git sometimes needs you to write a text comment. When this is the case, it will
launch a text editor to enable you to type the comment in. If you don’t have
strong preferences for a particular editor, then <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nano</span></code> is a good choice, so run
the following line in the terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>git<span class="w"> </span>config<span class="w"> </span>--global<span class="w"> </span>core.editor<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;nano -w&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you have Visual Studio Code set up to run from the terminal, then this is
another good choice of Git editor. Run the following to check that you can run
Visual Studio Code from the terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>code<span class="w"> </span>-v
<span class="go">1.62.0</span>
<span class="go">b3318bc0524af3d74034b8bb8a64df0ccf35549a</span>
<span class="go">x64</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You will almost certainly see different version information, and this is fine.
Assuming that worked, run the following to set Visual Studio Code as your Git
editor:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">git config --global core.editor &quot;code --wait&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you have a different favourite text editor, you can set it using the

<p>Once we start using Git to interact with GitHub, there are some very technical
choices to be made about the precise behaviour of Git when two users have
edited the same repository. We needn’t go into the details of this here, but we
do need to make a choice of this configuration, and the following one will do:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>git<span class="w"> </span>config<span class="w"> </span>--global<span class="w"> </span>pull.rebase<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">true</span>

<p>You will need your own GitHub account. This is completely
separate from any computer account you might have, so you need to sign up
separately. If you’ve already got a GitHub account then you don’t need another
one. Assuming you don’t already have an account,
navigate to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/">https://github.com</a> and sign up for an account.</p>
<p>There are three fields to fill out:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Email Address</dt><dd><p>You need to use a real email address that works and you have access to, as
GitHub will send you a verification email which you need to respond to. If
you are a student or staff member at an educational institution, it’s a

<p>Your GitHub account will store code that you spent valuable time writing. You
will therefore really want to avoid losing that work through some nasty person
gaining unauthorised access to your GitHub account and exploiting it for their
nefarious purposes. For this reason, it is a really, really good idea to enable
two factor authentication on your GitHub account (and, indeed, all your other
online accounts). Navigate to <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication">https://docs.github.com/en/authentication</a> and select “Securing your

<p>The exercises in this book are available as GitHub repositories, including
skeleton code and automated testing. The way that you use Git and GitHub to
access and do these exercises is always the same, though there are two
different ways of initially generating your personal exercise repository on
GitHub, depending on whether you are doing these exercises as a part of a
formal course which the instructor has set up using GitHub classroom, or you
are doing the exercises by yourself in private study. If you’re using GitHub
classroom as a part of a formal course where the instructor will be using
GitHub classroom then follow the instructions in <a class="reference internal" href="#accept-classroom"><span class="std std-numref">Section 2.6.1</span></a>.

<p>For each exercise, your module will provide access to a link that you can use
to accept the corresponding GitHub classroom assignment. In this case, there is
a tiny toy assignment created just for this exercise. The assignment acceptance
link is available on the exercises page for this book:
<a class="reference external" href="https://object-oriented-python.github.io/edition2/exercises.html">https://object-oriented-python.github.io/edition2/exercises.html</a></p>
<p>When you click on the assignment, if you’re not already logged into your <a class="reference external" href="https://GitHub.com">GitHub</a> account then you will be prompted to do so. If this is
your first GitHub Classroom assignment, you’ll also be asked to give GitHub
Classroom permission to access your GitHub account. You should do so.</p>
<p>You will now be asked to accept the assignment. Do so by clicking on the large
green button. GitHub Classroom will now create a new repository containing your
personal copy of the assignment. You can click on the link provided to navigate
to your new GitHub repository. You will also receive an email inviting you to
this repository. You can now skip forward to <a class="reference internal" href="#exercise-instructions"><span class="std std-numref">Section 2.6.3</span></a>.</p>

<p>If you don’t have an instructor who has set up GitHub Classroom exercises for
your course then you will obtain your copy of the exercise by creating a new
repository in your GitHub account using the template provided. To use the
template, navigate to the exercise repository, which in this case is:

<p>Whichever way we accessed the exercise, we now have an exercise repository. If
we scroll down on the front page of the GitHub repository website, we see the
README file for this repository. In this case, this gives us the instructions
for the assignment. For most of the exercises in this course, the instructions
will be in this book at the end of the relevant chapter. This time, we see
this:</p>
<img alt="_images/git_exercise.png" src="_images/git_exercise.png" />
<p>So what we have to do is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Edit <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exercise.txt</span></code> to replace “Hello World” with “Hello Mars!”</p></li>
<li><p>Commit this change.</p></li>
<li><p>Push the result to GitHub.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We’ll go through each of these steps and what they mean below. First, though,
we’ll need to clone the repository to our computer.</p>
</section>
<section id="cloning-the-repository">
<h3><span class="section-number">2.6.4. </span>Cloning the repository<a class="headerlink" href="#cloning-the-repository" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Your new repository currently exists only on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, but
you need a local copy on your machine (or on a remote machine that you’re logged
into) in order to work on it. This is called cloning the repository. Here
we show how to do this using commands in the terminal, because this approach is
the most likely to be available on all systems.
Start by <a class="reference external" href="https://imperial-fons-computing.github.io/terminal.html#terminal" title="(in Installation instructions for FoNS v2020.0)"><span class="xref std std-ref">opening a terminal</span></a>.</p>
<p>Next, you will need the URL of your GitHub repository. On the repository
webpage, click on the large green <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Code</span></code> button on the right:</p>
<img alt="_images/git_clone.png" src="_images/git_clone.png" />
<p>Click on the little picture of a clipboard to copy the URL. Now, back in your
terminal type (without pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">enter</kbd>):</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>git<span class="w"> </span>clone
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Paste the URL you copied into the terminal after <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clone</span></code> and then press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">enter</kbd>.
If you are asked for your GitHub username and password, enter them, and the
repository will download. The process should look a little like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>git<span class="w"> </span>clone<span class="w"> </span>https://github.com/dham/hello.git

<p>This will create a new folder in the current folder containing the repository.
The folder will have the same name as the repository on GitHub, so in this case
it’s called <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hello</span></code>. The command to change the current
folder is <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cd</span></code> (for “change directory”) so we now change into our repository:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>hello
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can now check that we’re in the folder we think we’re in by running the
command <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pwd.html#module-pwd" title="(in Python v3.11)"><code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pwd</span></code></a> (“print working directory”):</p>

<span class="gp">$ </span>/Users/dham/hello
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This shows me that we’re in the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hello</span></code> folder in my user
folder (<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/Users/dham</span></code>), which is what I expect.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>There are several other ways of cloning a GitHub repository, including over
ssh or using specialist graphical or command-line Git clients. Any of these
approaches is equally valid to the one shown here. The only approach which
will not work properly is to download the zip file of the repository. This
will download all the files and folders, but none of the data Git needs for
revision control.</p>
<p>The instructions here focus on command line interfaces because it’s a lot
easier to ask for help if you get stuck with a command line interface. “I
typed the following and this was the resulting output” is a much easier and
more precise way of describing a problem than attempting to explain what
you did in a graphical interface.</p>

<p>I can now check out what’s in
this folder with the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> command (for “list”):</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>ls

</div>
<p>There are four files or folders here, one of which is <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exercise.txt</span></code>, which is
the one I need to edit. I could use any text editor for this purpose, for
example if I have Visual Studio Code installed then this would be a very
suitable editor. However here we’ll only assume that you’ve installed <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Git</span></code> so
we’ll use the very basic editor <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nano</span></code>, which is almost certainly installed:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>nano<span class="w"> </span>exercise.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will open the nano editor in your terminal. You should see something like
the following:</p>
<img alt="_images/nano.png" src="_images/nano.png" />
<p>Now you can use the arrow keys and keyboard to delete “World” and replace it
with “Mars!” (remember the exclamation mark!) Don’t try to move to the end of
the line by clicking with the mouse, that won’t work (nano is far too basic for
that!)</p>
<p>Once you’ve edited the line, you need to save the file and quit nano. Helpfully,
nano shows a lot of its options along the bottom of the screen. We just need to
know that the caret symbol (<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">^</span></code>) stands for the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">control</span></code> key. So we press
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">control</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">O</kbd> to write out (save) our changes (Note for Mac users, this really
does mean the <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">control</kbd> key, and not <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">⌘</kbd>). Nano will offer us the option of
changing the filename, but we don’t want to do that so we just press <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">enter</kbd> to
save to the same file:</p>
<img alt="_images/nano-write-out.png" src="_images/nano-write-out.png" />
<p>Next we quit nano by typing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">control</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">X</kbd>.</p>

<span id="commit-push"></span><h3><span class="section-number">2.6.6. </span>Committing our changes<a class="headerlink" href="#committing-our-changes" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now that we’ve changed <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exercise.txt</span></code>, we need to tell Git to record this
change. Each change (to one or many files) that we tell Git about is called a
“commit” and the process is called “committing”. First, we take a look at what
Git can currently see about our repository. The command for this, indeed the go
to command whenever you’re not quite sure what’s going on in your Git
repository, is:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>git<span class="w"> </span>status
<span class="go">On branch main</span>
<span class="go">Your branch is up to date with &#39;origin/main&#39;.</span>

<span class="go">Changes not staged for commit:</span>
<span class="go">  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)</span>
<span class="go">  (use &quot;git restore &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)</span>
<span class="go">        modified:   exercise.txt</span>

<span class="go">no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Let’s pull this apart line by line. The first line says that we’re on the
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main</span></code> branch. Branches are a somewhat more advanced feature, but here we only
need to understand that <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main</span></code> is the default name for the main place to store
commits in a Git repository.</p>
<p>To understand the second line, we need to know that Git, by default, calls our
repository on GitHub <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">origin</span></code>. So the second line means that, as far as Git can
see, every commit that exists on our machine is also on GitHub, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Next comes a blank line, we’ll come back to what might appear there shortly.
The next line says “Changes not staged for commit”. This means that Git can see
that these files have changed or have been added, but Git has not been told
that they should be committed. Git is also very helpful in telling us what we
probably want to do next, so we are informed that we can tell Git that we
intend to commit a file using <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span></code>, or we can undo the changes in a file
back to the last committed version using <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">restore</span></code>. Finally, Git tells us
that right now there are no changes added to commit, so we either need to use
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span></code> or the shortcut version <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span> <span class="pre">-a</span></code>. We’ll come back to the
second of those presently, but first let’s learn about <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span></code>.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The default branch may be called something other than <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main</span></code>. In
particular, older repositories often have a default branch called <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">master</span></code>.
It doesn’t matter what the default branch is called.</p>

<p>We want to commit our changes to <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exercise.txt</span></code>, so we tell Git to add it to the
list of files to be committed:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">git add exercise.txt</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can check what that did by running <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">status</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>git<span class="w"> </span>status

<span class="go">        modified:   exercise.txt</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The first two lines of the output are unchanged, but now we see that
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exercise.txt</span></code> appears on the list of changes to be committed. We say that the
changes are “staged” for commit. Git once again helpfully tells us that if we
didn’t mean to do that then we should use the command <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">restore</span> <span class="pre">--staged</span></code> to
unstage the file. However, we did mean to stage <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exercise.txt</span></code> so now we can go
on to make the actual commit.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Some sites on the internet advocate the following version of <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span></code>:</p>

<p>This is a <strong>very bad</strong> idea. What this command does is stage for commit
every file in the repository that is not exactly the same as the already
committed version. This can include any number of automatically generated
binary files that you have generated or that your computer uses to manage
the file system. Committing these files makes a complete mess of your
repository and can cause conflicts if you try to clone your repository on
another machine. Don’t use <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span> <span class="pre">-A</span></code>!</p>

<section id="the-actual-commit">
<h4><span class="section-number">2.6.6.2. </span>The actual commit<a class="headerlink" href="#the-actual-commit" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Having staged the file(s) for commit, we need to actually make the commit. We do
this with the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>git<span class="w"> </span>commit<span class="w"> </span>-m<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;Changed World to Mars&quot;</span>
<span class="go">[main 316a22c] Changed World to Mars</span>
<span class="go"> 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span></code> tells Git to commit all staged files. Git always needs a message
describing what has changed. I’ve provided this by passing the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-m</span></code> option
followed by the commit message in quotation marks. If I were to leave off the
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-m</span></code> option and commit message, then Git would open the text editor I configured
earlier (nano) for me to enter the commit message. I would save the commit
message and quit the editor, after which the commit would go ahead as above.</p>
<p>Let’s use our go to command, <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">status</span></code> to see what we’ve done:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>git<span class="w"> </span>status
<span class="go">On branch main</span>
<span class="go">Your branch is ahead of &#39;origin/main&#39; by 1 commit.</span>
<span class="go">  (use &quot;git push&quot; to publish your local commits)</span>

<span class="go">nothing to commit, working tree clean</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is now quite different from what we’ve seen before. We’re still on branch
main, but now we’re informed that we’re ahead of <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">origin/main</span></code> by one
commit. This is because we’ve made a commit locally on our machine, but we
haven’t yet pushed that change up to GitHub. Git helpfully informs us that we
could remedy this situation using <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">push</span></code>. Because we’ve committed all the
changes we made, we’re also informed that there is nothing more to commit.</p>
<p>Before we proceed to pushing our changes to GitHub, we’ll take a look at a
quicker way to stage and commit changes in a single command.</p>
</section>
<section id="stage-and-commit-in-a-single-command">
<h4><span class="section-number">2.6.6.3. </span>Stage and commit in a single command<a class="headerlink" href="#stage-and-commit-in-a-single-command" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Most of the time, you will make changes to one or more files that Git already
knows about. In these circumstances, there’s a shortcut command, and it’s one
that Git already hinted to us about. Instead of separately running <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span></code>
followed by <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span></code>, we can use <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span> <span class="pre">-a</span></code>. We still need to provide
a commit message, so the equivalent to the two commands above would be:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>git<span class="w"> </span>commit<span class="w"> </span>-am<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;Changed World to Mars&quot;</span>
<span class="go">[main 316a22c] Changed World to Mars</span>
<span class="go"> 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now if we type <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">status</span></code>, we discover we are in exactly the same state as
when we type the two commands separately:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>git<span class="w"> </span>status
<span class="go">On branch main</span>
<span class="go">Your branch is ahead of &#39;origin/main&#39; by 1 commit.</span>

GitHub:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Depending on your configuration, you might have to enter your GitHub username
and password. The output includes quite a lot of detail that we currently don’t
care about, but the last two lines tell us which GitHub repository we were
pushing to, and that we pushed the local main branch to the GitHub main
branch.</p>
<p>If we now type <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">status</span></code>, we find that we are no longer ahead of
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">origin/main</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>git<span class="w"> </span>status

<span class="go">nothing to commit, working tree clean</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If we turn back to the repository website on GitHub, we can also see that the commit has arrived:</p>
<img alt="_images/github_post_commit.png" src="_images/github_post_commit.png" />
<p>Notice that we can see the commit message both in the bar at the top of the
file list, and next to the file that we changed. By clicking on the little
clock icon at the right hand side of the top bar, we can see a list of all the
changes that have ever happened on the main branch of our repository:</p>
<img alt="_images/github_commit_list.png" src="_images/github_commit_list.png" />
<p>Clicking on the title of any of these commits, produces a colour-coded
rendition of the exact changes that occurred at that commit. For example, if we
click on the title of the commit that we just made, then we find:</p>
<img alt="_images/github_diff.png" src="_images/github_diff.png" />

<span id="git-hash"></span><h3><span class="section-number">2.6.7. </span>Reporting the commit hash<a class="headerlink" href="#reporting-the-commit-hash" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes you might need to identify a particular commit, for example to submit
a piece of coursework, or to identify the particular code about which you are
asking for help. Git associates a unique string of characters with each commit.
This is known as the commit hash, because it’s a cryptographic hash value of the
files in the commit. However it’s not important how the commit hash is computed,
all that one needs to know is that the hash value is sufficient for someone else
who has access to your repository to find the exact commit that you mean.</p>
<p>It is possible to find the hash of a commit locally, in the copy of the
repository on your computer. However this is a dangerous practice, because you
might not have pushed that commit to GitHub, so you risk sending someone on a
wild goose chase for a commit that they will never find. It is therefore a much
better idea to grab the commit hash for the commit you want directly from the
GitHub web interface. The most reliable way to find the commit hash is to follow
the steps above to navigate to the commit in which you are interested. The
commit has his the 40 character hexadecimal number on the right: in this case
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">316a22cedb8627940aee7f1744297708324102f1</span></code>.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">2.6.8. </span>Autograding with GitHub Actions<a class="headerlink" href="#autograding-with-github-actions" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Notice in the commit list above that the final (top) commit has a green tick
mark next to it, while the previous commit has a red cross. These marks appear
because GitHub has been configured to automatically run tests on each commit to
provide immediate feedback as to the correctness of the work. Autograding is
the generic term for this sort of automated testing when applied to coursework.
It doesn’t necessarily imply that you will receive marks for passing the tests.
If we click on the green tick and then on <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">details</span></code>, we can see a little more
information:</p>
<img alt="_images/github_autograding_pass.png" src="_images/github_autograding_pass.png" />
<p>This case isn’t all that interesting, because we’re passing everything.
It’s actually more interesting to go back and click on the red cross:</p>
<img alt="_images/github_autograding_fail.png" src="_images/github_autograding_fail.png" />
<p>By expanding the line with the red cross and scrolling down, we can see the
details of the test that has failed. Hopefully this will give us some indication
as to what we have done wrong:</p>
<img alt="_images/github_autograding_fail_detail.png" src="_images/github_autograding_fail_detail.png" />
<p>This is indeed very useful as the error tells us that the test was expecting
“Hello Mars!” but instead found “Hello World”. This is clearly a trivial
example, however the tests provided with the exercises in this book also
attempt to provide useful feedback on what has gone wrong when a test is
failed.</p>
