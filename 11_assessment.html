<p>For those taking this course for credit in Oxford, an assessment is required.
This will take the form of a report, since that is how MMSC special
topics are assessed.</p>

    </div><div class="proof-content">
<p>Develop a Python package that implements an algorithm or algorithms
for solving a clearly-specified class of mathematical problems.</p>
<p>The project should involve a substantial amount of novel
programming. You should use existing open-source libraries where
appropriate, but the libraries used should not address the main
purpose of your program. For example, if you were implementing
Krylov methods for solving linear systems, your code should use the
scipy sparse matrix classes (since you need these for efficiency),
but should not use the scipy implementations of Krylov methods.</p>
<p>The code should exhibit the principles of good programming described
in the course. The code should be well-structured, well-documented,
and tested thoroughly.</p>
<p>The University’s guidance on plagiarism applies both to the code and
the report: in particular, the code should not incorporate samples
available on the internet without due acknowledgement.</p>
<p>The report should be of about 10–20 pages in length. It should
motivate and describe the class of mathematical problems your code
aims to solve, briefly describe the algorithms that attempt to solve
them, and discuss the Python code written for the project. The
report should persuade the reader that the code is implemented
correctly, is well-tested, and is reasonably efficient. Continuing
the example of Krylov methods, if the code employed dense matrix
formats to represent sparse matrices, it would be orders of
magnitude slower, and hence would not be reasonably efficient. For
demonstrating correctness, consider a code for solving differential
equations. The code should employ the method of manufactured
solutions to construct a test case for which an analytical solution
is known, so that the order of convergence achieved by the code (in
some norm) matches that expected theoretically.</p>
<p>A typical report will include selected code snippets, to demonstrate
how the code is used, and to illustrate the main ideas in how it is
structured, implemented, and tested. The report should not typically
include the entire code. You will submit a .zip archive of your code
alongside the report, so that the assessors can execute and evaluate
it.</p>
<p>Please ensure that the code submitted in the .zip installs cleanly
in a clean virtual environment with <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">-e</span> <span class="pre">.</span></code>, which should
also install any dependencies necessary to run the tests and examples.</p>
<p>Many students develop ideas for their Python projects from their MSc
dissertations. If you can develop code that will be useful for your
MSc research, this is valued and encouraged. However, due regard
should be paid to the University’s guidance on plagiarism, and in
particular on self-plagiarism; you should not submit the same work
for credit twice. A typical pattern might be that you will implement
Algorithm A from the literature in your Python in Scientific
Computing report, while in your MSc research you will develop
extensions and modifications of Algorithm A to Algorithms B and C.
Your MSc dissertation would then clearly state that the
implementation of Algorithm A was submitted for credit for Python in
Scientific Computing (and cite your PiSC report), while the
extensions to Algorithms B and C was conducted as part of your
dissertation research.</p>
<p>Rather than develop code from scratch, it is also possible and
encouraged to make contributions to existing open source codes (e.g.
by means of pull requests on github). In this case, your report
should clearly describe the capabilities of the software before your
contribution, as well the new features in your contribution. Your
contribution should implement substantial new features or
algorithms, rather than merely fix bugs.</p>
<p>The report will be assessed primarily on the beauty, elegance, and
correctness of the code. Other factors under consideration will
include the mathematical interest of the class of problems solved,
and the application of the code to interesting problems.</p>
