<span id="introduction"></span><h1><span class="section-number">1. </span>Introduction: abstraction in mathematics and programming<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-abstraction-in-mathematics-and-programming" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>A core tool of mathematics is to define abstract objects and the
operations which apply to them. This approach defines all the basic
building blocks which enable us to reason mathematically and perform
calculations. We start off with basic objects like numbers and define
arithmetic operations on them. As we become more sophisticated, we
define more and more complex objects, with appropriately more involved
operations: matrices, polynomials, sets, groups, algebras. Being able
to reason at the level of abstract objects is essential in making
mathematics comprehensible. Consider matrices: linear algebra would be
highly impractical at best if we could not define matrix addition and
multiplication, and had instead to work directly with sums of products
of scalars. More generally, without abstraction the edifice of higher
mathematics would rapidly collapse under the weight of its own
complexity.</p>
<p>The situation in computer programming is strikingly similar. At the
simplest level, the central processing unit of a computer is capable
only of a limited set of rather primitive arithmetic and logical
operations on a few finite subsets of the integers, and of the
floating point numbers. However, on this tiny foundation is built
every piece of software in existence, including very sophisticated
programs for text manipulation, higher mathematics, sound and
video. Moreover, this software is routinely created by ordinary people
using relatively modest amounts of effort. How is this possible? It is
possible because of the same principle of abstraction which underpins
mathematics: more abstract objects and the operations on them are
defined in terms of simpler ones.</p>
<p>Think about plotting a graph on a computer. As a 21st century
mathematician you don’t write loops over arrays to compute the pixel
values that will result in the right curve appearing on a screen, you
use a high-level language such as Python which has plotting objects
which take in data and perform all of those calculations for
you. Where did those plotting objects come from? They are the result
of the manipulation of lower-level abstract objects in a chain that
eventually ends up with primitive operations on integers and floating
point numbers. But, critically, as the person wanting to plot some
data <em>you don’t care</em>.</p>
<p>Why, then, as a mathematician should you care about abstraction in
programming? There are two key reasons. First, because an
understanding of the abstractions on which software is built will give
you a better understanding of how that software works and will
therefore make you a better user of that software. The second is that
making appropriate use of abstractions will make you a better
programmer of mathematics and other software. Applied well, objects
and abstraction produce software which is easier to write, easier to
understand, easier to debug, and easier to extend. Indeed, as with
abstraction in mathematics, abstraction in coding is a form of
constructive laziness: it simultaneously allows the mathematician to
achieve more and do less work.</p>

<p>In order to do the exercises in this book, you’ll need some core software
tools. At various points you’ll also need install several more Python packages,
but you don’t need to install those right now. The core tools you will need
are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Python version 3.7 or later.</p></li>
<li><p>Git (the revision control system we’re going to use).</p></li>
<li><p>A Python-aware text editor or <a class="reference internal" href="#term-integrated-development-environment"><span class="xref std std-term">integrated development
environment</span></a> (IDE). Visual Studio Code is recommended, and all the
instructions will assume that this is what you are using.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Installation instructions for these pieces of code are provided <a class="reference internal" href="installation.html"><span class="doc">on
this page</span></a>.</p>
<p>This is not a course about Git, but a minimal familiarity with Git and GitHub
will be needed in order to work with the examples. <a class="reference internal" href="a2_git.html#git"><span class="std std-numref">Appendix 2</span></a>
provides an elementary introduction to these tools for readers not already
familiar with them.</p>
<section id="python-versions">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.1. </span>Python versions<a class="headerlink" href="#python-versions" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Python is a living language which regularly releases new versions. One very big
transition, which took over a decade, was the switch from version 2 to version
3 of the language. For many years both versions were in widespread use and
texts needed to cover their differences. However, Python 2 officially reached
end of life on 1 January 2020 and not even critical security updates are now
made to that version. You should, therefore, only ever use Python 3, and all
references in this book are to that version.</p>
<p>Within Python 3, there is a minor version release approximately every year.
Once released, this receives security updates for 5 years. At the time of
writing, Python 3.11 is the newest release version, and Python 3.7 is the
oldest version that still receives security fixes. The user-facing differences
between minor Python versions are usually fairly minimal, so for the purposes
of this book it doesn’t matter which of the currently supported versions of
Python you use.</p>

</iframe></div></details><p>In the course of the exercises, You’re going to create, edit, and install a
whole bunch of Python packages. It’s highly desirable have a predictable
programming environment in which the experiments you’re doing don’t interfere
with anything else for which you might be using Python, and conversely which
remains unaffected by any packages you may have installed elsewhere. This
separation can be achieved by working in a Python <a class="reference internal" href="#term-virtual-environment"><span class="xref std std-term">virtual
environment</span></a>, or <a class="reference internal" href="#term-venv"><span class="xref std std-term">venv</span></a>.</p>
<p>A virtual environment is a folder containing a local installation of Python
which links back to the Python you installed on your computer. This means that
virtual environments behave like separate Python installations for most
purposes, but are fast to install and take very little space because they share
most of their files with the already installed Python.</p>
<section id="creating-a-working-folder">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.2.1. </span>Creating a working folder<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-working-folder" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Start by creating a completely fresh folder for your work on this book. You can
call this anything you like. On my computer this is called
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">principles_of_programming</span></code>. You can create this folder using the
Windows File Explorer, Mac Finder, or by typing the following in a terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>mkdir<span class="w"> </span>principles_of_programming
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Obviously you replace <code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">principles_of_programming</span></code> with whatever you
decide to call the folder. The dollar sign is the command prompt. Its different
on some systems, for example, it’s often a greater than sign (<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></code>) or a percent
symbol (<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%</span></code>). The text to the left of the command prompt might also be
different depending on which terminal program you are using on which operating
system, but we are only concerned with the commands to the right of the prompt.</p>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p>Modern operating systems are quite capable of dealing with folder names and
file names containing spaces. However, there are many pieces of software
(including some Python packages) that don’t correctly deal with spaces in
folder and file names. It’s therefore a safer option to avoid spaces and
instead to separate words with underscores (<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_</span></code>).</p>

<section id="creating-the-venv">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.2.2. </span>Creating the venv<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-the-venv" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now that we have our working folder, we will switch to doing everything in our
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-IDE"><span class="xref std std-term">IDE</span></a>, so launch Visual Studio Code. Click on <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Open...</span></code> in
the main window or in the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">File</span></code> menu and select the folder you just created.
This will open a Visual Studio Code workspace in that folder. You will probably
be able to see a terminal window at the bottom of the screen. If it’s not
there then open the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">View</span></code> menu and select <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Terminal</span></code> to make it appear.</p>
<p>The most straightforward way to create a venv is on the terminal
command line, not from within Python itself. This is accomplished
using Python’s <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv" title="(in Python v3.11)"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">venv</span></code></a> package. The venv has to be given a name. You will
want this to be short, but distinctive enough that you know which venv you are
using. For example, to create a venv
called <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PoP_venv</span></code> on Windows, you would type:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">&gt; py -m venv PoP_venv</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>while on Mac or Linux you would type:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>python3<span class="w"> </span>-m<span class="w"> </span>venv<span class="w"> </span>PoP_venv
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Don’t forget that the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></code> or <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$</span></code> stands for the command prompt: you don’t
type it. This command will create the folder <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PoP_venv</span></code> and various
subfolders containing things like the Python program itself and space
for any packages which you install in the venv. If there was already a
file or folder called <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PoP_venv</span></code> in the current folder then you’ll get
an error, so make sure you choose a new name.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Running <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">py</span></code> on Windows or <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python3</span></code> on Mac or Linux is a mechanism to
attempt to ensure that the right version of Python runs. If you have
multiple Python installations on your computer then you might end up
running the wrong one. If this happens then you will need to type the full
path to the Python you want to use (starting with <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/</span></code> on Mac or Linux or
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\</span></code> on Windows). Once the venv is installed and activated, it will be
sufficient to type <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python</span></code> as the venv will ensure that this is the
correct version.</p>
</div>
<p>A venv doesn’t usually contain any particularly valuable data, so you
should regard them as essentially disposable. In particular, if
something goes wrong when creating a venv, just delete it and start
again. In the bash or zsh shells you would type:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>rm<span class="w"> </span>-rf<span class="w"> </span>PoP_venv
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p><code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rm</span> <span class="pre">-rf</span></code> will delete its argument and all its subdirectories
without further prompts or warnings. There is no undo operation.
Be very careful about what you delete.</p>

<span id="activate-venv"></span><h3><span class="section-number">1.2.3. </span>Using a venv<a class="headerlink" href="#using-a-venv" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you run Python from the terminal, then the simplest way to use the
venv is to source its activate script. If using bash or zsh on Mac or
Linux you would type:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span><span class="nb">source</span><span class="w"> </span>PoP_venv/bin/activate
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>while using bash on Windows you would type:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span><span class="nb">source</span><span class="w"> </span>PoP_venv/Scripts/activate
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If using PowerShell on Windows then you type:</p>
<div class="highlight-powershell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">.\</span><span class="n">PoP_venv</span><span class="p">\</span><span class="n">Scripts</span><span class="p">\</span><span class="n">activate</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ps1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Obviously, you would use the folder name of your venv instead of
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PoP_venv</span></code>. In either case, your command prompt will change to indicate
that you are now using the venv. It might look something like:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(PoP_venv)</span> <span class="gp">$</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Any subsequent invocations of Python commands such as <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python3</span></code> will
now use the version from the venv, with access to whatever packages
you have installed in that venv. If you are using a terminal shell
other than bash or zsh, then see the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv" title="(in Python v3.11)"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">venv</span></code></a> package documentation
for the correct activation command.</p>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p>The default permissions settings on your Windows computer may not permit you
to run the activation script. This can be fixed by running:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">&gt; Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For further information, see <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" title="(in Python v3.11)"><span class="xref std std-doc">the official Python venv documentation</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p>Venv activation is just for one terminal session. You need to activate the
venv every time you open a new terminal, though if you are lucky then
Visual Studio Code will notice the venv and activate it for you. If you
find that Python can’t find your packages or tests, then the first thing to
check is whether you remembered to activate the venv.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">1.3. </span>Installing Python packages<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-python-packages" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we’ve created and activated a venv, and now there’s a Python package
we’d like to have access to. Installation of Python packages is handled by the
Python package <a class="reference external" href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/" title="(in pip v23.2)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Pip</span></a>, which you will usually find
pre-installed in your Python installation. Pip has many usage options, which
enable a large number of different installation configurations. However, for
most users most of the time, a few simple pip commands suffice. As with
venv creation, package installation is best accomplished from the
terminal and not from within Python itself. Don’t forget to activate the venv!</p>
<section id="installing-packages-from-pypi">
<span id="install-from-pypi"></span><h3><span class="section-number">1.3.1. </span>Installing packages from PyPI<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-packages-from-pypi" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org">PyPI</a> is the Python Package Index. It is the
official download location for publicly released Python packages which
aren’t themselves a part of the built-in <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html" title="(in Python v3.11)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Python Standard Library</span></a>. Many important mathematical packages
including <a class="reference external" href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html#module-numpy" title="(in NumPy v1.25)"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy</span></code></a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sympy.org">sympy</a> are
distributed from PyPI. Suppose your venv doesn’t have <a class="reference external" href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html#module-numpy" title="(in NumPy v1.25)"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy</span></code></a>
installed and you need it. You would install it with the following
terminal command:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(PoP_venv)</span> <span class="gp">$ </span>python<span class="w"> </span>-m<span class="w"> </span>pip<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>numpy
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It is also possible to invoke pip directly using the command <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip3</span></code>,
but there are some circumstances where that might result in pip using
the wrong Python installation. The approach used here is safer.</p>
<p>Python packages may depend on other Python packages, so it’s quite
likely that pip will install more packages than those you directly
asked for. This is necessary if those packages are to actually work.</p>
<p>Pip can also be used to upgrade a package to the latest version:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(PoP_venv)</span> <span class="gp">$ </span>python<span class="w"> </span>-m<span class="w"> </span>pip<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>--upgrade<span class="w"> </span>numpy
