   This is the online textbook for the Oxford course on Python in Scientific
   Computing, offered to MSc students on the MSc in Mathematical Modelling and
   Scientific Computing, and to DPhil students. The lecturer for this course
   is `Patrick E. Farrell <https://pefarrell.org>`_. Please address all
   questions about the course to Prof. Farrell.
   
   This course is a fork of the MATH50009 Principles of Programming course
   prepared by `David A. Ham <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/david.ham>`_,
   offered to mathematics undergraduates at
   Imperial College London. Prof. Farrell is very grateful to Dr Ham for his kind and
   generous assistance in this matter. The videos recorded by Dr Ham sometimes refer to Imperial-specific
   matters such as assessments; please ignore these.
   
   A suggested timetable for Oxford students might be the following:

   but of course you can go through the course at your own pace, as suits your other assignments.

   This website builds on the book Object-oriented Programming in Python
   for Mathematicians, written by Dr Ham. Here you'll find the full hyperlinked book text, as well
   as consolidated lists of the accompanying :doc:`videos <videos>`.
